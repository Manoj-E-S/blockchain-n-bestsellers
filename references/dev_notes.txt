Commit [Manoj E S][Tue May 7 00:52:22 2024 +0530] : [Implement ipynbs for training and prediction - iteration1]
- A basic embedding implementation of the MatrixFactorisation approach to Rating Prediction system (Book recommender - primitive) is done
- Fixes required:
  - Works only if user and book embeddings have same size [Make variable user, book data sizes acceptable]
  - Add more NN Layers to improve accuracy - accuracy is not impressive rn.
- Enhancements:
  - Incorporate book-matadata and user-metadata in the model.
