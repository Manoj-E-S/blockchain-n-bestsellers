Commit [Manoj E S][Tue May 7 2024 00:52:22 +0530] : [Implement ipynbs for training and prediction - iteration1]
- A basic embedding implementation of the MatrixFactorisation approach to Rating Prediction system (Book recommender - primitive) is done
- Fixes required:
  - Works only if user and book embeddings have same size [Make variable user, book data sizes acceptable]
  - Add more NN Layers to improve accuracy - accuracy is not impressive rn.
  - Incorporate book-metadata and user-metadata in the model.


Commit [Manoj E S][Tue May 21 2024 02:03:30 +0530] : [Test GMF MLP model - GMF is better - refer stats. Implement popularity based book recommender. Update updated_books.csv to suit Content based filtering of Book recommendations.]
- Not much difference between the GMF and MLP approaches - if we go by stats, GMF is better a teensy bit.
- Fixed Bugs:
  - Works on new users.
  - NN layers added and tested.
- Fixes required:
  - Should work on new books - Googlebooks API and content based filtering
  - Can try incorporating, user- and book-metadata in the Collaborative Filtering model.
